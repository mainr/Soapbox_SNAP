    /// Ok, so in order for an application to use the Twitter API, you have to sign up for 
    /// a Twitter consumer key and consumer secret.  This just means you're registering your
    /// application with Twitter.  You can do that here: http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new
    /// 
    /// Once you do that, they'll give you a Consumer Key and a Consumer Secret, which are just
    /// strings.  These are used to authenticate your application when you use the API, either
    /// with OAuth or xAuth.  Now OAuth is great for web applications, and in that case your
    /// source code and binary is sitting (presumably) safely on a web server somewhere, so
    /// you're never exposing your key or secret to the world.  For desktop applications, like
    /// SoapBox Snap, you have to embed these into the application.
    /// 
    /// I chose to use xAuth for SoapBox Snap to make it simpler for the user.  That means I don't
    /// have to send the user to a new web page to sign in with their username and password... they
    /// just enter it into SoapBox Snap and we take care of everything.  However, that means I had
    /// to send an email to api@twitter.com to get them to enable xAuth for this application.
    /// Note that if you replace these keys with your own, you will need to do the same.
    /// 
    /// During that email exchange, they said that my application key and secret need to be
    /// kept hidden.  They did acknowledge the near-impossibility of this request, of course, 
    /// because (a) it's an open source application, and (b) even with a binary, you could
    /// decompile it and get the strings out of it.  Twitter asked for a "best faith effort"
    /// or something like that.  So here it is... absolutely pathetically stupid Rot13 encoding
    /// of the key and secret.  All this really does is protect the strings from a naive
    /// dumping of the strings in the binaries and they're not distributed in "plain text"
    /// in the source code.
    /// 
    /// Ultimately I lay this squarely on the shoulders of Twitter.  If there's a better way,
    /// I'm willing to listen, but I'm not wasting more of my time thinking about it.
    /// 
    /// FYI, to replace these strings with new ones, use http://www.rot13.com/
